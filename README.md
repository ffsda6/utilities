Python app that can read an external JSON file, parse it to capture URI values, and test those values to identify which are valid websites and which aren't, excluding any values containing "androidapp".

Here, we're using the json module to load the data from a file called data.json, which contains a list of items with a uri key. We then loop through each item and check if it has a uri key, and if it does, we test whether it's a valid website using the is_valid_website function.

The is_valid_website function uses the requests module to send a GET request to the URI, and checks whether the response status code is 200 (OK). If it is, the function returns True, indicating that the URI is a valid website. If there's an exception or the status code is not 200, the function returns False.

If the URI contains "androidapp", we exclude it from the testing and print a message indicating that it has been excluded. Otherwise, we print a message indicating whether the URI is a valid website or not.

Here, we're using the open function to create a new file called results.txt, which we open in write mode ('w'). Then, instead of printing the results to the console, we're writing them to the file using the write method of the file object.

Note that we're also adding a newline character (\n) at the end of each line we write to the file, so that each result is on a separate line.

After the loop is finished, we print a message indicating that the results have been saved to the file.

Make sure you have write permission for the directory where the file is created.

Note that in order to use the requests module, you'll need to install it using pip install requests if you haven't already.
